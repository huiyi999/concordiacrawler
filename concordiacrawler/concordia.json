Her work as a museum database assistant at the McGill Visual Arts Collection gave her a solid background for the program’s range of activities, she says.\n“The professional experience that I accumulate during this two-year position will help support my strong interest in the maintenance and preservation of artworks and documents.”\nMonnier is an Ojibwe woman and member of Lac Seul First Nation. She previously worked in several archives, special collections and small museums, including at Queen’s University Archives. In April 2020, she completed the RBC Indigenous Internship Program at the Canadian Museum of History in Ottawa.\n“While at Concordia, I would like to gain experience to foster Indigenous approaches to librarianship and archival studies,” Monnier says. “I hope to work with Indigenous communities in preserving oral history traditions and curating Indigenous material through digital heritage management projects.”\nGuylaine Beaudry, Concordia’s vice-provost of digital strategy and university librarian, says the program represents a step in the right direction.\n“We are just beginning to decolonize our libraries, our spaces, our catalogues — there is so much yet to be done,” she notes. “This is an issue of great importance to our profession. There is a lack of diversity within our libraries that needs to be addressed.”\nBeaudry adds that Montreal is the only city in Canada that has two schools that teach library and information studies. She also thinks there should be more projects like this in the city, which benefits from the concentration of universities.\n“It’s a great example of collaboration between three Montreal institutions, of coming together to move forward and take positive action.”\nThe program offers the Indigenous student a chance to work on a range of activities in an academic library setting, under the mentorship of professional librarians, while completing a master’s degree.\nFrom special collections and projects to reference and instruction, the student will get a chance to contribute to the library and the wider Concordia community while bolstering professional skills. They will also get funding to attend one conference related to Indigenous librarianship and receive support from the Aboriginal Student Resource Centre.\n“By working as a student librarian, alongside those who have been in the profession for years, they will gain firsthand, on-the-job knowledge, which is vital,” says Lorie Kloda, associate university librarian for planning and community relations.\n“Our hope is that when their time with us ends and they graduate, they will have the necessary experience to begin a long and successful career in academic librarianship or archives.”\nStudents may choose to stay within a university setting or go off to work in public schools or cultural centres in their own communities. Beaudry says the program is about more than diversifying the Concordia Library.\n“It’s about Indigenous people having an active role to play within the library profession in Quebec and Canada. It’s just the first step in terms of the Indigenous directions the library wants to take. We want to do more and we need to learn in order to do so. It’s important to do this right.”\nTo apply, students must be accepted into the Master of Information Studies Program at McGill or the Maîtrise en sciences de l’information at Université de Montréal and begin their studies in the fall term. The application process for next year is open now until February 12, 2021, at 5 p.m.\nThe position guarantees 15 hours of work per week from September to April and 30 hours per week from May to August, for two years. Tuition and student fees will also be waived by the host university.\nApplications may be submitted in either English or French as a single PDF file to Lorie Kloda at lorie.kloda@concordia.ca.\n\nFind out more about Concordia’s Indigenous Student Librarian Program.\n \nConcordia’s Indigenous Student Librarian Program taps into the city’s strengths\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n‘An issue of great importance’\nA chance to gain hands-on experience\n‘It’s important to do this right’\nEligibility\n\n\n\n            Meet the newest member of Concordia’s Aboriginal Student Resource Centre team\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia welcomes a new Indigenous Directions project coordinator\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia welcomes a new senior director of Indigenous Directions and a director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy\n        \n\n\n"},

Aligned with universities across Canada, we are closely following the directives of public health agencies and the government. \nStaff and faculty have been actively responding to the needs of our researchers and will continue to respond moving forward in these extraordinary circumstances.\nBelow are answers to frequently asked questions for researchers. We will continue to update this page as new information becomes available. Information for graduate students can be found on the School of Graduate Studies website.\nFor other general questions on Concordia’s COVID-19 response, please visit Concordia's COVID-19 website.\n\nLast updated: December 4, 2020, 11:59 a.m.\n\nProcedures are now in place to support the resumption of in-person research with human participants or to continue essential field research.\nWe are working with the Government of Quebec, public health authorities and the City of Montreal as well as public transit commissions to use an approach centered on the respect of social distancing norms and on the protection of all.\nAs we have done throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we will adhere scrupulously to all public health directives and carefully consider the sanitization and subsequent use of shared spaces such as stairs, elevators and eating areas.\nTo ensure the health and safety of the community, research labs are being opened in phases. Security, safety and cleaning procedures are evaluated in accordance with Commission des normes, de l'équité (CNESST) protocols. \nConcordia has now re-opened more than 200 labs in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, fine arts and humanities.\nAlthough a lab is open, individuals wishing to return are required to first contact the professor in charge of the lab to follow an approval process. Professors with labs that do not appear on the list may request opening by contacting the Associate Dean, Research, of their Faculty.\n \nAn internal communication will be sent to department chairs about which labs will open each week.\nTo inquire about re-opening your lab, please contact your research supervisor or Faculty Associate Dean, Research.  General questions or concerns may be directed to the Office of Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies.\nThe university is following recommendations and guidelines of the CNESST and has enhanced cleaning and sanitization for areas that are frequented by faculty, staff and students. Additional hand sanitizing stations have been added. In addition, those accessing campus are required to use hand sanitizer upon arrival. Training has been implemented for all individuals accessing campus to ensure a common understanding of expected behaviours for the health and safety of our community. Learn more about the University’s workplace safety guidelines.  \n  \nFor the most up-to-date information, please refer to each agency’s website.\nConsidering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the evaluation of funding applications\n\nFor up-to-date information on Quebec agencies, please refer to the agency's website.\nPlease submit the grant extension request form to the Office of Research to request an extension.\nProgram Overview\nThe Canada Research Continuity Emergency Fund (CRCEF) is a temporary tri-council program established to help the research enterprise at Canadian universities and health research institutions that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding under this program is specifically provided to support non-governmental sources of research funding.\nYes, with the understanding that any planned research activities and associated timelines must take into consideration the limitations on access to lab spaces and in-person work.  Please contact a member of the Research Partnerships and Innovation team to discuss the opportunity and establish next steps.\nRequests of this nature must be handled on a case-by-case basis, as every sponsor will differ in its approach.  Please contact a member of our team to discuss the specifics and we will be happy to work with you, in conjunction with the sponsor, to determine what accommodations can be made through an amendment to the existing agreement.\nYes, you can still declare a new technology to the Office of Research.  Please contact us for guidance on the process.\nWhile researchers are still strongly encouraged to proceed with remote/online research, with proper ethics approval for this type of work, Concordia has implemented a gradual resumption of in-person research involving human participants. The process is detailed here. An amendment to an existing protocol may be required. Please contact the Ethics Unit to determine the requirements for your specific situation. \n\nYou are required to submit an amendment request to your existing protocol.​ Since you may wish to return to in-person data collection once the current suspension is lifted, please do not remove any methodologies already approved under the protocol; rather simply request the addition of remote/online recruitment and data collection.\nThe amendment request must contain:\n\n​ All amendment requests should be submitted by email to oor.ethics@concordia.ca.\n\nPriority review of COVID-19-related projects, as well as rush review of amendments requesting the transition to remote/online research, have been implemented.\n\n The committee continues to meet as per its usual schedule, and the review of regular protocols is not disrupted.​\nThe Secretariat on Responsible Conduct of Research has shared new interpretations from the Panel on Research Ethics to support the community in applying the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, TCPS 2 (2018) during the current COVID-19 publicly declared emergency. \n\nThere are three different categories of additional research-attributable risk that can arise in the COVID-19 environment:\nNew risks arising from changes to researcher’s plan for interacting with participants:\nFor example, a researcher may decide to communicate with participants remotely instead of in-person to respect physical distancing and mitigate the transmission/spread of the virus through human contact. While this may address risks related to physical contact, researchers and research ethics boards (REBs) should be mindful that this change introduces new risks and ethics issues related to privacy and confidentiality of information when using digital platforms and home offices, and the need for new security and safety measures to protect participants’ information. Where, for example, researchers attempt to reduce the risk of infection by mailing experimental drugs to participants rather than continuing in-person participation, this will likely require a change to the researcher’s plan for monitoring any side effects.\nDepending on the participant pool, the change from in-person to remote participation may also introduce new ethics issues related to fairness and equity, where only those with access and ability to participate remotely (e.g. due to internet connectivity, computer/ smart phone availability and capacity) can continue to participate in the research. “…[P]ractices of researchers or REBs, whether intentional or inadvertent, can exclude some members of society from participating in research” (Chapter 4, Introduction).\nNew risks that emerge, even if the research plan remains unchanged:\nFor example, the continued participation of participants who provide weekly blood samples at a hospital may subject them to new risks of exposure to the coronavirus during their commute, or as a result of their proximity to other participants or to members of the research team. Also, new public health requirements for reporting can introduce new risks related to privacy and confidentiality in ongoing research. For example, if new security standards require researchers to retain the participants’ personal information for contact tracing purposes, researchers can no longer guarantee participants’ anonymity (see Application of Article 5.2).\nIn addition to risks of increased participant exposure to the virus, there are possible societal risks of further transmitting the virus beyond the individual participants to other third parties, including family members.\nChanges in risk levels arising from changes to the participants’ personal circumstances:\n\nDuring the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, “participants … may be rendered more vulnerable by the nature of the emergency” (Application of Article 6.21). Vulnerabilities can be psychological due to isolation, stress, anxiety, or for economic reasons due to financial burdens of the pandemic or unemployment. Vulnerabilities can also be social in nature due to limited access to critical services, or physical vulnerability due to pre-existing medical conditions or age. For example, when research on self-harm or suicide involving participants began in non-pandemic times and continues in a COVID-19 environment, researchers need to re-assess the vulnerability of their participants in the context of research. Researchers should consider the additional stress that participants may be experiencing in their personal life. Participants who take part in ongoing research at a research site may be anxious or fearful about exposure in a potential COVID-19 environment, and may no longer wish to continue participating in research. Similarly, a high-risk research study conducted in-person to test a new drug on immunocompromised patients may be deemed acceptable for those participants in non-pandemic times. However, the risk to participants may rise to unacceptable levels in a pandemic context. Participants may no longer accept risks they would have otherwise accepted in non-pandemic contexts. Others may be willing to accept risks they would not have otherwise accepted, in the absence of a known cure for COVID-19 or COVID related complications; for example, participation in treatment trials for those infected with the virus or participation in prevention trials, including participation in vaccine studies.\nChanges or unanticipated issues that may increase the level of risk for participants or that have other ethical implications affecting participants’ welfare must be submitted for research ethics board (REB) review (see Articles 6.15 and 6.16). As with other changes to the research, the level of additional risks and their impact on the welfare of participants determine when researchers should report the changes to the REB - whether immediately, or if the researcher can document and summarize the changes in annual status reports. Where applicable, researchers must also provide to the REB their plan to manage additional risks through safety plans or technical safeguards, and their efforts to reach a favorable balance of risks and benefits for participants.\nAs with the assessment of the ethical acceptability of research, the REB review of the changes “involves consideration of the foreseeable risks, the potential benefits and the ethical implications of the research” (Article 2.9). REBs assess those risks that are attributable to the research. The TCPS states that “[w]hen describing the foreseeable risks and potential benefits of research involving participants who are also exposed to other risks, researchers should clearly distinguish between the risks that are attributable to the research, and the risks to which participants would normally be exposed” (Article 2.10).\nResearchers must inform participants of the changes or unanticipated additional research-attributable risks as part of their “ongoing duty to provide participants with all information relevant to their ongoing consent to participate in research” (Article 3.3). In deciding when, how, and how frequently to advise participants of additional risks, researchers and REBs should be guided by the level of those risks and their impact on the potential welfare of participants. They must also consider whether any other policies or requirements apply to the changed circumstances that create the additional risks. These policies and requirements might be sufficient measures to address the identified risk, and therefore changes to the research are not required.\nThe onus is on the researcher to satisfy the research ethics board (REB) that the research can proceed during the pandemic. The following are some questions that REBs should consider in reviewing the ethical acceptability of initial submissions of research or ongoing research in a pandemic environment. Each research is different, and the nature of participant pools varies, so the issues to consider should be tailored on a case-by-case basis.\nImpact on Study Conduct and its Scientific Validity\nImpact on Risks and Benefits of Research\nImpact on the Consent Process\nOther Ethics Issues\nThe university no longer authorizes work-related travel and strongly advise all members of our community against travelling for any purpose for the foreseeable future.\nRegarding research travel — if you have incurred expenses already relating to research travel, note that the federal granting agencies — Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) — will consider the reimbursement of such non-refundable travel fees due to the COVID-19 situation as acceptable. This applies to the travel of both principal investigators and research personnel, when cancellation occurs.\nLes Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) has also announced that they will also consider the reimbursement of such non-refundable travel fees due to the COVID-19 situation as acceptable.\nIn line with this approach, Concordia will also reimburse such charges on PDA or other Concordia research funds accounts for which such travel related expenses are permitted.\nFor other externally funded research grants, we plan to treat such charges in alignment with the Tri-Agency’s approach. As needed, if a granting agency announces a position that they will be unable to fund reimbursements for non-refundable travel fees due to COVID-19, Concordia will ensure to provide an alternative source of funding.  \n \nYes. If you travel outside of the country during the holiday break, you must quarantine for 14 days upon your return.

This is especially true for first-year students, who are inevitably lacking much of the in-person socializing and learning that makes the new experience of university so exciting.\nThe good news is there is a pilot program aimed to help Concordia newcomers beat isolation.\nHomeroom is a weekly meeting space for first-years to learn, connect and grow. It provides them with the opportunity to come together in weekly small groups, facilitated by upper-year students, and learn about the information needed to succeed at Concordia.\nTopics range from clubs and services to proper stress-management techniques to navigating the university experience. The emphasis of these weekly one-hour meetings is on discussion — frequent back-and-forth conversations and enriching presentations — while simultaneously fostering friendships between students.\nSo far, feedback on the program has been exceedingly positive, with most current participants now closely knit with their fellow Homeroom members.\n“Homeroom helps me get through my week. It gives me a time to relax and it motivates me knowing it happens every Thursday,” says Anne-Sophie Malboeuf, a marketing and international business student at the John Molson School of Business. “I am happy to be part of this, and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a community.”\nMax Gervais, who is studying history in the Faculty of Arts and Science, sees Homeroom as an antidote to these difficult days.\n“It’s really fun and it relieves some of the stress from everything bad going on in the world. It also allowed me to meet people I now consider friends who I know I can turn to when I need help. It’s really mint.”\n\nFirst-year Concordia students can register for Homeroom today.\n \nBy Benjamin Mulchinock\nConcordia offers first-year students a fun new meeting space to beat isolation\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n‘It’s really mint’\n\n\n\n            Concordia’s student groups find creative ways to promote engagement during the pandemic\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia maps stress patterns among undergrads through a series of well-being surveys\n        \n\n\n"},

She sees herself as a big sister to First Nations, Inuit and Metis students who access the centre.\n“I have always found the ASRC to be a comfortable space, somewhere that I could get information and meet new people,” Robertson says. “My goal is to build on the great work the centre has been doing for our Indigenous students and to be someone they can come to for advice or if they need someone to listen.”\nBeyond her educational background, Robertson brings professional experience from her time as an after-school art program director in Kahnawá:ke as well as seven years as an elementary school teacher, and will focus on creating events to foster community.\n“Though the pandemic has made in-person events impossible this year, we will look at creative ways to get together. I want to build on past events such as traditional feasts as well as bead making and medicine bag workshops.”\nASRC in-house cultural support worker Vicky Boldo says she’s very happy with the new addition to the team.\n“As a current Indigenous graduate student at Concordia working on her thesis, Azure has a deep understanding of the general challenges students face,” Boldo says. “Moreover, in light of this year’s online learning and juggling life, it is reassuring to have Azure with us. Her professional, personal and academic experience align with and even exceed this position.”\n\nIf you are an Indigenous student, be sure to check out all that Concordia’s Aboriginal Student Resource Centre has to offer.\n \nBy Christian Durand\nMeet the newest member of Concordia’s Aboriginal Student Resource Centre team\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n\n\n\n            A new Indigenous personas initiative seeks to achieve more inclusive digital environments at Concordia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia welcomes a new Indigenous Directions project coordinator\n        \n\n\n"},

That’s why the Office of Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies (OVPRGS) takes great pride in serving and supporting the university’s researchers. The Office offers an array of services to help dedicated researchers and promote the results of their research — whether it’s maximizing funding opportunities, establishing international research partnerships or guiding them through the university’s policies and procedures.\nManaging more than 100 graduate programs and 6,500 students, the Office also oversees admissions standards and graduation requirements.

The School is also home to the Special Individualized Program, a unique interdisciplinary program that allows outstanding students to create their own program of study, drawing on research interests that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.\nThrough Concordia International, the Vice-President plays a leadership role in promoting (international) student mobility as well as international research initiatives.\nThe Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery is part of Concordia University and is dedicated to the research, dissemination and critical examination of Canadian and international contemporary art. As part of its programming, it presents exhibitions, provides various educational programs and produces publications. Responsibility for all tasks related to the management, exhibition, research and conservation of the Gallery’s art collection is also part of its mandate.\nThe Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology is a research unit working at the intersection of design, art, culture and technology. It is a platform for progressive imagining, critical studies, creative experimenting and interdisciplinary training where thinking and making come together to transform our encounter with technology.\nThe PERFORM Centre is a unique facility dedicated to improving health through prevention.

The event is being hosted online December 9 by the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools. Winners will then proceed to the American national competition at the Council of Graduate Schools.\nPimentel, whose PhD research looks at how professionals create meaning when their expertise is challenged by technological and societal change, won first place in Concordia’s competition in June. She impressed the judges and audiences alike with her timely and polished presentation, “What do you do?”\nHer thesis specifically explores how the accounting industry has been challenged by emerging technology such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, and how a realignment of meaning can bring new value to the profession. It’s a pressing concern, given that some researchers believe the traditional work of accountants could be automated away in the next 15 years.\n“Participating in the 3MT competition has been a transformative experience,” Pimentel says. “The competition has enhanced my communication skills by teaching me how to translate my research from academic language into something we can all connect with.”\nShe adds, “I am humbled to represent Concordia on the big stage. The competition is going to be fierce but I’m working hard to craft a compelling message. I hope it will engage the viewers to think differently about how work fits into their lives, especially during a global pandemic.” \nThe semi-finals competition airs online from 3 to 5 p.m. on Wednesday, December 9.\n\nRegister here to watch the 3MT semi-finals competition live and cheer on Concordia’s Erica Pimentel!\n \n \nPublic Scholar and John Molson PhD student represents Concordia at the 3MT semi-finals\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n\n\n\n            Concordia’s Three Minute Thesis Competition goes virtual\n        \n\n\n"},

In some cases, they may need to postpone registering for their course until another session.\nPlease note that most in-person activities are optional.

Do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information. \nThe requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on your Student Center page or go to your Faculty or School’s advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below.\nHow to contact your academic advisor:\nIn most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre:\nThis displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the “details” link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans.\nIf available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will allow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor.\nNOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select ‘copy email address’. You may then paste the address into your email client.\nYou can also get more information about advising from the links below:\nThe registration system is accessed via MyConcordia with your netname and password. Once in MyConcordia, click on My Student Center and select Enroll.\nTo assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways:\nThe Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule.\nYou can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define.\nThis is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at Concordia University.\nPlease note the following:\nYou should consult the Undergraduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites not met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB students, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they can look into this matter for you.\nSome classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program are able to register for it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats to be reserved.  If you try to register for a class and receive a message about ‘reserved seats’ then you should select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, for JMSB students to obtain permission to take the class.\n\nSome classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class in order to obtain permission to register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office.\nThe Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule.\nNote that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to follow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A – Adding Classes.\nYou can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places in your student centre:\nLog into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “class schedule builder” link shown in the image below.\nLog into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Click the “SEARCH FOR CLASSES” button on the top right of the page.\n\nOn the Search for Classes page, click the “SEARCH WITH CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER” button.\nLog into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre. Then either click the ‘Enroll’ or ‘enrollment course cart’ links. Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE.\n\nOnce in the enrollment course cart, select the ‘Class Schedule Builder’ option (shown below) and click ‘search’.\nLog into the Student Information System and navigate to the Student Centre.  Select the ‘Class Schedule’ option from the drop-down list in the Academics section.  Then on the next page select the relevant term and click CONTINUE.\n\nOn the ‘My Class Schedule’ page, select the ‘View in Class Schedule Builder’ option at the top right.\n\nFor more information about how to use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, please watch the instructional video available on the Student Hub.\nThe Search for classes function is used to look for information about scheduled classes for a particular term and is generally available in early March. A variety of search criteria may be entered to narrow or broaden a search. Search results provide information such as date and time of classes, location, name of instructor, number of seats available and so on.\nOR\nTo search for classes:\nFor a Summer class, select “Summer 2020”\nFor a Fall class, select “Fall 2020”\nFor a Winter class, select “Winter 2021”\nFor a Fall / Winter class, select “Fall/Winter 2020-21” (6 credit FULL YEAR classes only)\nTo view classes in all terms of the academic year, select “ALL TERMS (2020-2021)\nNOTE: Any terms in the list that end in “(CCE Only)” will only return results for Continuing Education classes.\n.\nThere are three modes of instruction at Concordia:\nIn Person – In Person courses are taught in-person on a Concordia campus.\nOn-Line – On-line courses are taught online and not in a classroom setting.\nBlended Learning – Blended Learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. Class times, locations and specific dates listed in Days/Times and Start/End Date fields will indicate which in-class meetings are required. For more information, please see the notes tab or contact the department.\nThe Browse Course Catalog feature provides access to a comprehensive listing of information about courses offered at Concordia University.\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search > Browse Course Catalog\nTo browse for courses:\nImportant Note:  the existence of a course on this list does not guarantee that the course is currently offered.\nThe enrollment appointment date is the first date on which you may begin the registration process for that term.\nYour individual date will be displayed in the Enrollment Dates box on your Student Center page.\nExample:\nAlthough the enrollment appointment dates indicate when you will be able to start registering, you can start planning and filling your Course Cart in early March. \nThe enrollment appointment date is based on the number of credits to completion for your program if you are a degree student.\nIf you wish to calculate your enrollment appointment date, the following formula is used:\nProgram length (minimum credits required) minus credits earned minus in progress courses as of February 2019 (excluding DISC courses) equals credits to completion.\nFollowing are all the enrollment appointment dates for 2020-21:\nOn the enrollment appointment dates, the system is programmed to be available from 8 a.m. onward. The registration system may be extremely busy at 8 a.m. on each new enrollment appointment date so it is strongly recommended that you wait until later in the day.\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > My Academics\n\nIf the information concerning your program is incorrect you may contact 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 to find out how to make corrections. It is important for this information to be correct, as the wrong degree or concentration may block you from entering courses for which you are eligible.\nYou can add classes to your schedule for the selected term in three easy steps with a couple of restrictions to note:\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Add\nFind a class to add, using one of the options displayed, or, if you know the class number, enter it into the Enter Class Nbr field\nClass Search – refer to Step 3 B – Use the Class Search above if you need further help. To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course.\nIf satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose “select”.\nConfirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further:\nOnce you have selected the conference, press Next. \nYou will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart.\nAt this point, you may continue to add further courses to your Course Cart.\nOnce you have added all your required courses, you will need to click on the “Proceed To Step 2 of 3” button.\nIf your registration was successful you will see the following message:\nIf it was unsuccessful you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example:\nFor Example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study.\nRemember to register for all terms Summer (2191), Fall (2192), Fall/Winter (2193) and Winter (2194) at the same time – do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity.\nPlease note: If you only want to change sections of the same course see Step 6, C – Swapping classes.\nThere are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines.\nPlease note the following important details:\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table.\nClick the Continue button.\nAll registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections.\nSelect the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so.\nSelect the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC.\nYou can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available. \nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course.\nThere are some restrictions attached to swapping classes:\nTo swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.\n\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.\nClick the Continue button.\nThe first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled.\nThe next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it.\nSelect the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid.\nSelect the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid.\nIf you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page.\nIf you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page.\nIf you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page.\nConfirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button.\nIf the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar:\nView My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction:\nOnce all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search\nYou are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether or not a Wait List is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the Wait List total.\nThis tells you that 25 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 250 has been reached.\nThere are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list.\nYou start the registration process by trying to register for INTE 123 but the course is full and you get the following error message:\nYou use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled Wait list if class is full and select next.\nYou will see the resulting message:\nIf a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty.\nIf you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE 123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the course. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to “Wait list if class is full”.\nIf a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty.\nNote: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class.\nYou can verify your schedule in two different formats.\nFrom your Student Center page you can choose weekly schedule.\nThe resulting “My Class Schedule” page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. After selecting the term, press continue. You then have the choice of seeing your schedule in a list view or a weekly calendar view.\nThe list view is as follows:\nThe weekly calendar view is as follows:\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nThe Concordia Class Schedule Builder view is as below:\nOnce you have selected the term in the Concordia Class Schedule Builder, you will see the classes that you are enrolled in, are on the waitlist for, or have in your enrollment course cart.\nIf you encounter faculty-related difficulties (prerequisites, co-requisites, anti-requisites; permission of the department required; closed class, etc.) while using the Registration system, you must contact your department. Please refer to the following links:\n\nFor non Faculty-related problems, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 Monday to Friday, from 09:00 – 17:00, all year round, except for holidays.\nShould you experience technical difficulties, please contact the Concordia Service Desk at:\nPlease note that the Service Desk cannot assist you directly with any issues you are having registering for classes. You should contact your advisor or department or, for JMSB students, the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office initially and they will then contact the Service Desk on your behalf if it is an issue they are unable to resolve.\nInformation regarding your account balance is available from the Student Center page under the Finances banner:\nPLEASE NOTE – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you would like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “Account Inquiry” link in the top-left of the Finances section.  This will trigger a recalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly.\nFor more information about tuition fees and payment deadlines, please visit the Tuition and Fees page.\n.\nIt is possible that there may be a hold on your account which is preventing you from registering for courses.

For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar content.\nDegree students: You are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course.\n\n\nIndependent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “Prerequisite Waiver Form” and receive approval prior to registering.

If you need to correct your address or any other piece of personal information, click on the relevant area under the Personal Information banner and you will be redirected to another screen where you can make the necessary changes.\n\nPlease note that you are responsible for providing the University with your current mailing and e-mail address. You are required to fulfill all financial and administrative obligations within the prescribed deadlines regardless of the validity of your address in our files.\n\nStudent Hub > Get to know your self-service portal\nIf you have a financial hold you will not be able to register in classes until you clear the hold.\nClasses can only be added until the add/drop deadline for a given term.\nFor additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection.\nClass Schedule Builder – refer to Step 3 A – Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder above if you need further help.\nDNE – did not enter – The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees.\nDISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. A withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course.\nNot attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade.\nIf you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite.\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term.\nIf you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared.\nFor additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.\nIf you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold.\nClasses can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term. \nFor additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.\nIf you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes.\nThe swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course.\nSearch for the class using the search function in the With this class grid. You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled.\nConfirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed.\nVerify the swap transaction.\nView My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration.\n\n PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist.\n\nFor example:\nYou are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X.\nSelect the term\nSelect the subject\nSelect the course number\nSearch\nYou have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for that term.\nYou have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available, you would swap one course for another.\n\nYou can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term.\nYou cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course.\nYou can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature.\nThe weekly calendar view of your class schedule will not show any classes that occur on a national or university holiday.\n\n\nAny online classes that you are enrolled in will appear at the bottom of the calendar.\n \nBy phone: 514-848-2424, ext. 7613\nVia email at:  help@concordia.ca\nBy opening a ticket\nDue Now – this is the amount that you owe for the tuition and fees for the current term. An amount may show as ‘Due now’ before the final payment deadline. For example, the tuition fees for a Fall term are generally due at the beginning of September but you are allowed until the end of September to pay them without financial penalty. These fees will show as ‘Due Now’ in your Student Centre from the beginning of September.\n\n\nFuture Due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any upcoming term(s). For example, if you are enrolling in Winter classes before the beginning of January, the tuition fees for these classes will show as ‘Future Due’ in your Student Centre until the beginning of January.\n  \nCourse registrationAcademic advisingCourse withdrawals (DNE and DISC): An explainerUnderstanding your degree credit requirements The scoop on full and part-time statusGPA – what does it mean?Taking classes outside of ConcordiaTerm dates & deadlinesArchived 2019-2020 Term dates & deadlinesCourse withdrawals\nAcademic advisingCourse withdrawals (DNE and DISC): An explainerUnderstanding your degree credit requirements The scoop on full and part-time statusGPA – what does it mean?Taking classes outside of Concordia\nCourse withdrawals (DNE and DISC): An explainer\nUnderstanding your degree credit requirements \nThe scoop on full and part-time status\nGPA – what does it mean?\nTaking classes outside of Concordia\nTerm dates & deadlinesArchived 2019-2020 Term dates & deadlines\nArchived 2019-2020 Term dates & deadlines\nCourse withdrawals\nHelping you register for classes\nWaitlist feature\nHow to use the swap feature to resolve waitlist issues\nHow to browse the course catalogue\n\nHow to search for a class\nHow to register for a course\n\nHow to get on a waitlist for a class\n\nHow to drop a course\nHow to swap a course\nHow to use the course cart to select courses\nHow to view the Holds on your account\nRefer to the Graduate Calendar to verify your degree requirements and academic regulations.\nFind the right person to speak to in your graduate program for advising information.\n \nTime conflict\n You will not be allowed to register for courses where any of the class hours (including labs, tutorials, etc.) overlap with another course.\n\n\nRequisites\n Refer to the Graduate Calendar to verify the requisites for the courses in which you want to register.\n\n\nReserve seats\n Some classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs.\n\n\nDepartment consent\nSome classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class.\nLogin to MyConcordia with your netname and password.

If you already know the abbreviation of the Class Subject, type it into the blank field beside the “select subject” button. For example, type “ENGL” for English classes, or “FINA” for Finance classes.\nCourse Number\nThe “Course Number” field narrows the search down further to a specific class. For example, if you want to search for the POLI 202 class, you would enter “POLI” in the ‘Select Subject’ field above and then enter “202” into the ‘Course Number’ field.\nCourse Level\nThe “Course Level” field allows you to search for classes at a specific level. You can select multiple levels if you wish to view a larger range of results. For example, if you want to view all 200-level classes, select the “200” checkbox. If you want to view all 500 and 600-level classes, select both the “500” and “600” checkboxes.\nNOTE: The Course Level option can only be used for credit courses. This can be combined with the ‘Select subject’ field or the ‘Department or Faculty’ field to refine results.\nDepartment or Faculty\nThe “Department or Faculty” field allows you to search for classes offered by a specific department or faculty. For example, to search for classes offered by the Education department, select “Education” from the drop-down menu. To search for classes offered by the Fine Arts faculty, select “FACULTY OF FINE ARTS” from the drop-down menu.\n NOTE: When searching for classes offered by a Faculty, you may have to refine your search by selecting additional criteria.\nClass Times\nThe “Class Times” field refers to the class start and end times. Entering a time in the first field will search for all classes starting after the time entered. Entering a time in the second field will search for all classes ending before the time entered. These fields can be used together to search for classes within a desired range.\nNOTE: The times should be entered in a 24-hour format. For example, if you wish to search for 7am, enter “07.00”, or for 7pm, enter “19.00”.\nDays of the week\nYou can select any of the checkboxes next to the relevant day(s) of the week to include classes offered on that day in the search.\nNOTE: If you select a specific day, the search results will include classes that are scheduled on that day, including any classes that are split between the selected day and another day. For example, if you select the “Mon” checkbox only, you will see classes scheduled on a Monday only and classes scheduled on a Monday and Wednesday.\nLocation\nYou can use the “Location” field to search for any combination of ‘in-person’ classes scheduled at the ‘Sir George Williams (Downtown)’ or ‘Loyola’ campuses, or for ‘Online Courses.\nNOTE: If you search only for Online classes, then any Class Times entered or Days of Week selected will be ignored.\nInstructor Last Name\nSearch for classes taught by a specific instructor by entering the first few letters, the exact last name, or letters contained in the name.\nCourse Keyword\nSearch for a class by its title and description. Enter a full or partial keyword to return search results that include all classes with the keyword or partial keyword as part of the title or description.\nClass Nbr\nEnter the ‘Class Nbr’ if known. This is a 4 or 5-digit class number that a class is assigned in the Student Information System.\nNOTE: This is not the same number as the “Course Number” field above.\nMode of Instruction\nThere are three modes of instruction at Concordia:\nIn Person – In Person courses are taught in-person on a Concordia campus.\nOn-Line – On-line courses are taught online and not in a classroom setting.\nBlended Learning – Blended Learning courses are a combination of in-class and online learning. Class times, locations and specific dates listed in Days/Times and Start/End Date fields will indicate which in-class meetings are required.

Concordia is also developing protocols to establish how in-person activities will be conducted to conform with physical distancing and health and safety measures mandated by public health authorities.\nAlthough the Webster and Vanier libraries, as well as the Grey Nuns Reading Room, will remain physically closed, access to digital collections, “Ask a Librarian,” consultations with subject librarians, interlibrary loans and other online services are functional, and will continue to expand to include instruction and additional digital resources.\nConcordia Library is also providing restricted access to its physical collections over the fall term. For Course Reserves, the Library will ensure the best access possible for your students, as well as copyright compliance on your behalf. Consult the Library FAQ.\nThe Webster and Vanier libraries are open at a limited capacity to allow access to reserved single-seat study spaces for students. These study spaces are uniquely intended for those students who are not able to study at home. More information on how students can book spaces is available on the Library’s website.\nFollett, the new bookstore service provider on campus, will help with all your course material needs. Students will be able to purchase digital course materials through the provider’s website. Follett will also ship textbooks and coursepacks to students’ homes, whether they’re living in Montreal or elsewhere.\nA diverse selection of digital learning technologies will also be available. Follett will also offer affordable open educational resources content and courseware through Lumen Learning.\nFollett’s cost-saving print options include used books offerings and a text rental program that saves students up to 80 per cent compared to the price of a new title. Follett also has a popular price matching program, which helps ensure students get materials at the lowest cost possible, and a year-round buyback program.\nFutureReady and GradProSkills continue to offer professional and academic skills-development opportunities.\nIn addition, the university is increasing and adapting its services to support students through this exceptional time, including:\n\nThe university is also exploring ideas to build partnerships to help students enjoy the Montreal experience virtually.\nVisit the Centre for Teaching and Learning resource page for more information.\nAll employees have access to Zoom. Teaching assistants must activate their Concordia email address (firstname.lastname@concordia.ca) to gain access to the university’s Zoom license. Once activated, they can use Zoom for the duration of their contract.\n\nConcordia asks that faculty members secure stable, high-speed internet at home so they can teach remotely. A limited supply of data sticks is available for those who do not have internet access.\nEmployees who need to purchase any IT equipment using professional development allowance or research funds should use the intake form and indicate that they are making an emergency purchase request.\nConcordia will continue working and meeting with union leadership.

	{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2020/12/02/concordia-launches-the-kevin-austin-award-in-electroacoustic-studies.html", "content": "Concordia’s Department of Music officially launched the Electroacoustic Studies program 20 years ago, but like any great record, you can trace its roots through much deeper influences.\nFifty years ago, Kevin Austin co-taught a course called Contemporary Idioms and Media at Sir George Williams University. He remembers 35 students who enthusiastically explored many facets of contemporary music, a handful of whom also made “weird noises” on borrowed audiovisual equipment.\nBy 1971, 80 per cent of the program’s design was in place — a focus on perception, ear-training, composition, performance, psychoacoustics, history, repertoire and working with other artistic mediums — it just took the rest of the world 30 years to catch up.\nOn November 25, more than 70 Concordians from around the world virtually gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the department  with the announcement of the Kevin Austin Award in Electroacoustic Studies. It’s a gift that will support many electroacoustics studies students in perpetuity.\nMark Corwin, chair of the department, organized the award. He calls Austin one of his mentors.\n“Working alongside Kevin over the last 30 years, I've come to understand and adopt his vision. His initiatives have made this program so successful.”\nCorwin has also been impressed by Austin’s outstanding record of supporting students.\nHe has funded 11 distinct student awards at Concordia and his gifts have helped more than 70 students over the past 35 years.\n“It dawned on me that Kevin had established these numerous awards, but none of them bear his name. So, four years ago, I started contributing to a fund called the Kevin Austin Award,” Corwin explains.\nThe award is a $35,000 contribution towards the Faculty of Fine Arts and the Campaign for Concordia: Next Gen. Now. Many alumni, faculty and friends in the music community joined him to contribute to this new award, including alumnus Richard Reed Parry (BFA 03) of Arcade Fire.\n“It's through Richard’s significant donation that the Kevin Austin Award is now fully funded and ready to support an award for this year, our 20th anniversary,” Corwin notes. “And will continue to support one student per year, in perpetuity.”\nParry vividly remembers benefitting from one of Austin’s awards during his last year at Concordia.\n“I was working very hard on way more things than one person could reasonably attempt to simultaneously accomplish and I was spread very thin.”\nOn top of his full course load, he played in two bands, curated an art show, performed music for dance classes, edited film, recorded concerts, composed music and took an Independent Study course with Austin.\nHe was also broke, living on free school lunches and sneaking onto buses with expired transfers. In the midst of this instability, he received the award.\n“At that moment, it totally saved me. I felt such relief, such joy that some of my sprawling artistic efforts were being noticed, regardless of how unfocused or interdisciplinary. I could eat, I could take the Metro, I could function. It was a vote of confidence that I desperately needed.”\n\n\nAustin has a stack of letters and emails on his desk from Concordia students whom his “small gifts” have helped over the years. Many speak of how the recognition opened doors for them they didn’t know existed.\n“Everyone stands on other people's shoulders. I stand on those of so many people who I have owed gifts to over the years that I can never pay back,” Austin says.\n“I learned early on the way, that to pay back is to pay forward. In 1981, I began building awards named for people who were significant in my own development and who went out of their way to improve the quality of my life.”\nThe future of a fine arts education is about relationships, making sure energy flows between people, both in and outside the classroom, Austin adds. He sees this award in his name as both an honour and an investment in future music students.\nAs for Parry, he says he’s proud to be part of creating this award in Austin’s name. “If only everyone who eventually receives this award could somehow take classes with him.”\n\n\nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Music.\nContribute to the Kevin Austin Award in Electroacoustic Studies.\n\n\nConcordia launches the Kevin Austin Award in Electroacoustic Studies\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\nGenerous contributions\n‘It totally saved me’\n‘Everyone stands on other people's shoulders’\n\n\n\n            Concordians receive 15 META nominations for their contributions to theatre\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia scholar receives major Universities Art Association of Canada award\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordian Ashley Raghubir wins 2020 Canadian Art writing prize\n        \n\n\n"},

Her work as a museum database assistant at the McGill Visual Arts Collection gave her a solid background for the program’s range of activities, she says.\n“The professional experience that I accumulate during this two-year position will help support my strong interest in the maintenance and preservation of artworks and documents.”\nMonnier is an Ojibwe woman and member of Lac Seul First Nation. She previously worked in several archives, special collections and small museums, including at Queen’s University Archives. In April 2020, she completed the RBC Indigenous Internship Program at the Canadian Museum of History in Ottawa.\n“While at Concordia, I would like to gain experience to foster Indigenous approaches to librarianship and archival studies,” Monnier says. “I hope to work with Indigenous communities in preserving oral history traditions and curating Indigenous material through digital heritage management projects.”\nGuylaine Beaudry, Concordia’s vice-provost of digital strategy and university librarian, says the program represents a step in the right direction.\n“We are just beginning to decolonize our libraries, our spaces, our catalogues — there is so much yet to be done,” she notes. “This is an issue of great importance to our profession. There is a lack of diversity within our libraries that needs to be addressed.”\nBeaudry adds that Montreal is the only city in Canada that has two schools that teach library and information studies. She also thinks there should be more projects like this in the city, which benefits from the concentration of universities.\n“It’s a great example of collaboration between three Montreal institutions, of coming together to move forward and take positive action.”\nThe program offers the Indigenous student a chance to work on a range of activities in an academic library setting, under the mentorship of professional librarians, while completing a master’s degree.\nFrom special collections and projects to reference and instruction, the student will get a chance to contribute to the library and the wider Concordia community while bolstering professional skills. They will also get funding to attend one conference related to Indigenous librarianship and receive support from the Aboriginal Student Resource Centre.\n“By working as a student librarian, alongside those who have been in the profession for years, they will gain firsthand, on-the-job knowledge, which is vital,” says Lorie Kloda, associate university librarian for planning and community relations.\n“Our hope is that when their time with us ends and they graduate, they will have the necessary experience to begin a long and successful career in academic librarianship or archives.”\nStudents may choose to stay within a university setting or go off to work in public schools or cultural centres in their own communities. Beaudry says the program is about more than diversifying the Concordia Library.\n“It’s about Indigenous people having an active role to play within the library profession in Quebec and Canada. It’s just the first step in terms of the Indigenous directions the library wants to take. We want to do more and we need to learn in order to do so. It’s important to do this right.”\nTo apply, students must be accepted into the Master of Information Studies Program at McGill or the Maîtrise en sciences de l’information at Université de Montréal and begin their studies in the fall term. The application process for next year is open now until February 12, 2021, at 5 p.m.\nThe position guarantees 15 hours of work per week from September to April and 30 hours per week from May to August, for two years. Tuition and student fees will also be waived by the host university.\nApplications may be submitted in either English or French as a single PDF file to Lorie Kloda at lorie.kloda@concordia.ca.\n\nFind out more about Concordia’s Indigenous Student Librarian Program.\n \nConcordia’s Indigenous Student Librarian Program taps into the city’s strengths\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n‘An issue of great importance’\nA chance to gain hands-on experience\n‘It’s important to do this right’\nEligibility\n\n\n\n            Meet the newest member of Concordia’s Aboriginal Student Resource Centre team\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia welcomes a new Indigenous Directions project coordinator\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia welcomes a new senior director of Indigenous Directions and a director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy\n        \n\n\n"},

	{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2020/11/13/concordia-students-design-food-for-future-trips-to-mars.html", "content": "Outer space has always held a fascination for humans.\nThe next Mars rover is due to touch down in February 2021. SpaceX announced its plans to launch the first flight to Mars, without as crew, in 2024. And national space agencies are collaborating to launch the Lunar Gateway space station into orbit, intended to get us one step closer to the red planet.\nBut even though Mars is currently the closest it has ever been to Earth, a 225-million kilometre one-way trip still takes at least six months, and a round trip can take up to 21 months. Current foods used in space have a shelf life of 18 months. So if humans eventually set out for Mars, what will they be eating?\nThat’s a question that a student team in Concordia’s SynBioApps program wants to answer. The students have embarked on an ambitious two-year project that uses synthetic biology to bioengineer a space-compatible microorganism that can produce nutrients, such as Vitamin A, in space.\nStudents in the program, from the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, are working on a project dubbed AstroYeast. They are taking it to this year’s iGEM Virtual Giant Jamboree, a worldwide student bioscience competition. At iGem, multidisciplinary teams work together to design, build, test and measure a system of their own design using interchangeable biological parts and standard molecular biology techniques.\n“Currently, NASA sends dehydrated food packets and supplements, such as vitamins, to fulfill the nutritional needs of astronauts,” explains team member Lancia Lefebvre, a student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. “These supplements are necessary to keep our astronauts healthy.”\nFor example, astronauts have been shown to become deficient in vitamin D, since the major source of it is sun exposure.\n“While providing supplements shipped from Earth has been an effective solution for travels to the International Space Station (ISS), it isn’t a sustainable one for space missions of long distances and durations. Producing vitamins on site is the way to go. And for that, we need AstroYeast.”\nFellow team member Hajar El Mouddene, a student of behavioural neuroscience in the Department of Psychology, notes that AstroYeasts are cellular super mini-factories that are resilient to microgravity-induced stress.\nThe team hopes AstroYeast will solve the problem of creating food in conditions of microgravity, where gravity is very small and creates extreme environmental stressors on cell function and morphology, limiting the ability to grow robust food in space.\n“We are designing resilient yeast strains that will behave in ways that are similar to the way they do here on Earth,” El Mouddene says.\nTo perform their experiments, the team is building a microgravity simulator and a space-compatible bioreactor. They are also collaborating with other iGEM teams, scientists and industry experts from across the globe.\nLefebvre says the project is timely for both governments and industry.\n“Beforehand, access to ISS through government agencies was the only option for researchers who were seeking to send their experiments to space, which was a very long and selective process. Now, there are companies opening up the horizon to researchers from around the world who wish to get their projects there.”\nThe team members admit that COVID-19 meant new challenges. But they say the payoff from an online iGEM project was an unprecedented opportunity to work with scientists from places like NASA and the Canadian Space Agency.\nLefebvre says many people took time out of their schedules to consult with them on the project and share invaluable resources.\nEl Mouddene adds that the project helped break isolation during the pandemic.\n“Students have said, ‘iGEM has made me excited about my career and my time here at Concordia. I used to be by myself studying. Now I’m out and talking to people about research.’”\nAnd the team isn’t slowing down anytime soon. While they look forward to growing AstroYeast in the lab next year, they are now participating in a few judged iGEM conferences, prior to the international conference. While building their microgravity simulator, they are collaborating with Women in STEM Concordia, and they will be contacting researchers working on bioreactors who are also working with yeast in microgravity.\n“We also plan to have a celebration after the Giant Jamboree with our team, super-duper graduate mentors and the ones we could never do without, our supervisors Orly Weinberg and Aashiq Kachroo at the Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology,” says El Mouddene says.\nLefebvre sees no limits for their research. “As humans, we have exploration in our veins. We love the unknown, and we are going for it.”\n\nLearn more about Concordia’s SynBioApps program.\n \nThumnail image of Mars by Kevin Gill (Flickr Creative Commons).\n \nConcordia students design food for future trips to Mars\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n‘We are designing resilient yeast strains’\n‘We have exploration in our veins’\n\n\n\n            Concordia students use synthetic biology to tackle the opioid crisis\n        \n\n\n"},

	{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2020/11/16/concordia-launches-the-next-generation-cities-institute.html", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing cities the world over to transform the configuration of their public spaces and services to ensure the health and safety of their citizens. They will also be looking at ways to reclaim their economic and cultural vibrancy once the pandemic is under control. Many aim to take action while maintaining their commitments to adopting more ecologically sustainable practices.\nThese are the types of challenges that will inform research at Concordia’s newly established Next-Generation Cities Institute.\n“Cities are great places. Because of their density, they can be the most efficient and sustainable form of human development,” says Ursula Eicker, who holds the Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Communities and Cities at Concordia.\n“They generate most of the world’s gross domestic product and are the locus of innovation and productivity. At the same time, they are responsible for two thirds of carbon emissions. If we don’t transform cities worldwide, we’re going to have serious problems.”\nEicker has spent the past year establishing the Next-Generation Cities Institute. She and Carmela Cucuzzella, Concordia University Research Chair in Integrated Design, Ecology and Sustainability for the Built Environment, are the institute‘s co-directors.\n“We’re incredibly excited about this new initiative,” says Concordia President Graham Carr. “Sustainability is an issue of global importance and Concordia is committed to addressing it. The Next-Generation Cities Institute will be essential to mobilizing research to further our goals.”\nThe institute combines over 200 researchers within 14 university research centres representing disciplines ranging from science and engineering to the humanities and arts.\n“The cities institute brings together researchers from across the university who think about smart, sustainable and resilient cities,” says Cucuzzella.\nIt will provide a framework for the interdisciplinary collaboration uniquely required for next-generation city planning.\n“There are so many researchers across the university already doing incredible work in this field,” she says.\n“The institute is an opportunity to show Concordia’s strength in this area. But also, more importantly, it is a chance to bring these researchers together and allow them to contribute to larger projects that can have real impact.”\nBy 2050, it is expected that up to 75 per cent of the world’s population will live in cities, making their efficient design all the more important.\n“We sometimes have a difficult time conceptualizing the scale of the challenges. To safely absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that we currently create, we would essentially need a whole second planet’s worth of vegetation,” Eicker says.\n“We also sometimes don’t realize how multifaceted these challenges are. All of it matters. Where the energy comes from, how efficient transportation and buildings are. Many projects attempting to be eco-friendly only focus on one issue but forget the rest. We need cities as a whole to be designed with all these relevant factors in mind,” she adds.\n“There are also important social factors. No matter how efficient and advanced a city is, if it is organized in such a way that no one can afford to live there, then we’re not any further ahead.”\nBecause many of the factors affecting sustainable cities are interconnected, addressing the problems facing next-generation cities requires a unification of diverse research efforts.\n“We think of the city as an ecosystem. It’s about the resilience of the city, but that also means the resilience of the community,” says Cucuzzella.\n“A large part of my own work is about establishing community-academic dialogue to foster new collective knowledge. The underlying vision is one where design becomes a critical and creative platform for an inclusive and collective making of the city,” she says.\n“As an institute, we want to build new knowledge about the integrated, sustainable design of our urban environments, passing from the technical, to the built, to the socio-cultural qualities of the city, and we want this knowledge to be shareable with other cities around the world.”\nEicker insists that anyone interested in making life better should be interested in this project. “We want to create extensive partnerships and an expansive network,” she says.\n“We need a global view, and this is precisely what the institute is intended to offer. We’re operating with a very open structure and anyone whose work relates to cities can contribute.”\nThe Next-Generation Cities Institute’s open, flexible and horizontal structure helps support its transdisciplinary effort. The institute aims to set a standard for international research that addresses such global and far-reaching challenges.\nPaula Wood-Adams, interim vice-president and research and graduate studies, says the institute will play a vital role in bringing researchers together to work towards common goals.\n“Concordia’s successful bid for the CERC created a wonderful opportunity to launch the institute,” she notes. “University-wide collaboration is essential for developing the kinds of projects that will have a meaningful impact on the future of our urban communities.”\nNow that the Next-Generation Cities Institute is taking form, Eicker says Concordia researchers want to reach out to partners in cities and communities to decide on first joint projects. “We are actively looking for partners to work on sustainable city transformation.”\nEicker says the institute project is ambitious, and the challenges it faces go far beyond the technical and scientific.\n“It’s also about bringing everyone together. We have to establish mutual cooperation between, for example, developers and activists, between artists and engineers. To initiate our work, we have started writing a four-volume comprehensive digital encyclopedia on all aspects of next-gen cities,” she reports.\n“We need people to be excited and able to work together. We have set up this whole structure to enable creative work in and with the city, involving citizens, decision-makers and industry in de-carbonization, greening and social inclusion projects.”\nFind out more about Concordia’s Next-Generation Cities Institute and join the official virtual launch event for the Next-Generation Cities Institute on November 26 by registering here.\nConcordia launches the Next-Generation Cities Institute\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\nThe importance and complexity of city planning\nOpen, flexible and horizontal\nAn open, flexible and horizontal structure\n\n\n\n            Intelligent buildings will make us healthier, more productive and greener, according to Concordia researcher\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Concordia researchers build web-based tool to reduce risk of indoor SARS-CoV-2 transmission\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            How do we build urban resilience in the face of crises like COVID-19?\n        \n\n\n"},

Each instalment of Terms will investigate the manifold meanings of a given word. The program is tripartite, featuring three components.\nFor the first component, the selected term will be explored in a short essay by a researcher working outside of the visual arts. He or she will examine the term through a particular lens, reflecting on the nuances, ambiguities, and plural meanings of the term.\nFor the second component, Gallery curator of research and program leader Julia Eilers Smith will pair the term with an existing artwork.\nIn the final component, a writer from the cultural sector will produce another short essay. Using the artwork as a point of departure, and drawing on the first essay, the writer will further explore various dimensions of the term and its significances.\nEach term will be twice presented in this tripartite form — twice in the given year — before another term is selected for the following year.\nTerms investigates how various, polysemic meanings are sedimented in words, how terms are disseminated, and how they alter public discourse.\nThe first edition of Terms explores the term Vulnerability.\nWriter, researcher, community organizer, and activist Mostafa Henaway explores the term ‘vulnerability’ in relation to his work with migrants.\n“If there is a term,” he writes, “that evokes a spirit of our moment, it is ‘vulnerability.’”\nHenaway depicts our ambivalent notions of vulnerability. The term can sometimes evoke empathy for migrants that are struggling. But ‘vulnerability’ is sometimes considered in terms of the apparent ‘natural’ limits of a person or organism. We see vulnerability as a person’s natural susceptibility to inevitable assaults from the outside.\nHenaway makes a case for other conceptions of vulnerability that allow it to be understood as something largely created through our own constructed political, economic, and social world.\nHe uses this notion of created “structural vulnerability,” exploring how various policies create adverse and exploitive conditions for migrant workers.\nHenaway’s essay is followed in the program by a short 1960s film by Canadian artist Joyce Wieland, Hand Tinting.\nArts writer Yaniya Lee develops the exploration of vulnerability through a reflection on the film.\nForming a continuity with the theme of labour, the film is comprised of leftover footage produced by Wieland when she worked at a youth employment training center. The center aimed to teach employable skills to disadvantaged youth.\n“Wieland’s task,” explains Lee, “was to film cutaways of the participants during downtime, allowing the recruitment documentary to show the centre’s atmosphere.”\nWhen the company rejected Wieland’s documentary, she made her own film using some of the footage. The film is hand-tinted and perforated in places with a sewing needle.\nIn her own account of the experience, Lee writes, Wieland was moved by the somewhat pitiful circumstances of the young, mostly black women, while also inspired by their courage and willingness to invest in themselves.\nLee uses the film to reflect on the use of vulnerable subjects as the ‘content’ of film and works of art.\n“Wieland ‘got’ the footage to make this film from a paid job; the girls she filmed were at a training centre seeking new opportunities,” Lee points out. “What does it mean to use other people’s bodies as matter” for a work of art?\nLee expresses her mix of admiration and distrust for Wieland’s work, wondering whether Wieland has advocated for vulnerable women or whether she has exploited them.\nLee concludes with a reflection on the relation between subject and work, this time questioning her own vulnerability as the writer making a subject of Wieland’s art.\nThe second posting of Terms will be launched in late January, 2021, examining vulnerability from another viewpoint.\n\nFind out more about the Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery at Concordia.\n \nLanguage and art: new online program launches at the Ellen Art Gallery\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\nVulnerability\n\n\n\n            Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery explores the disruptive potential of noise in photography\n        \n\n\n"},

While working for the SSHRC, Tremblay provided strategic guidance to Tri-Council presidents, members of the Canada Research Chair Coordinating Committee and the Minister of Science. She has appeared before the Canadian Senate and parliamentary standing committees.\nAnne Whitelaw, Concordia’s interim provost and vice-president, academic, says Tremblay’s vision and expertise will benefit the university’s vibrant, dynamic and research-engaged community.\n“As a Concordia alumna, Manon has the unique vantage point of having experienced the university as both a student and staff,” Whitelaw says.\n“She brings an Indigenous worldview, firsthand knowledge of the university’s strengths and a commitment to advocate for more equitable and inclusive futures for Indigenous peoples.”\nWhitelaw adds that Tremblay will have the full support of the president and members of the senior leadership team to ensure the successful implementation of the Indigenous Directions Action Plan.\n“The Action Plan is the result of the collective work of the Indigenous Directions Leadership Council and maps Concordia’s way forward in its efforts towards decolonization and Indigenization.”\nAs senior director, Tremblay will support ongoing efforts to obtain and maintain funding for research with, and by Indigenous peoples. She will also develop strategies to ensure culturally safe and respectful spaces on campus as well as support enrolment strategies to increase the number of Indigenous applicants to the university.\nShe will work closely with the Indigenous Directions Leadership Council and the strong team already in place at Concordia. Her work will see her partner with the special advisors to the provost, Concordia’s elder in residence, the Indigenous community liaison, the manager of the Aboriginal Student Resource Centre, the Indigenous student recruiter and the new director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy.\n“As Concordia’s new senior director of Indigenous Directions and chair of the Indigenous Directions Leadership Council, I look forward to working alongside the university’s many inspiring and engaged students, faculty, staff and community partners, and with my colleagues whose work specifically centres on decolonizing and Indigenizing the academy,” Tremblay says.\n“I’m excited about forging new collaborations and supporting existing partnerships to see our knowledge systems and protocols respectfully and meaningfully integrated within the university’s priorities, operations and structures.\n“As a Concordian,” she adds, “I take special pride in being able to contribute to building long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with Indigenous communities and organizations, and championing the pursuit of excellence in higher education for our peoples.”\nWhitelaw thanks Donna Kahérakwas Goodleaf for serving as interim senior director of Indigenous Directions and welcomes her to her new role as director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy.\n“As interim senior director of Indigenous Directions and chair of the Indigenous Directions Leadership Council, Donna provided seamless continuity and advanced the ongoing process of decolonizing and Indigenizing the university as outlined in the Indigenous Direction Action Plan.”\n“I am extremely grateful for her leadership and look forward to continuing to work with Donna on building a strong curriculum and pedagogy plan for Concordia in her new role,” she says.\nWhitelaw adds that she believes Manon and Donna bring complementary and critical leadership to fulfill the ambitious recommendations of the Indigenous Directions Action Plan.\n“I am thrilled that Donna accepted the new position of director, decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy. This is a priority area for the university. Donna’s influence, vision and experience will be invaluable to implementing the necessary changes to ensure that Concordia’s teaching and learning practices reflect the university’s commitment to decolonization and Indigenization,” says Whitelaw.\nGoodleaf begins her new role on December 3 and reports to Sandra Gabriele, vice-provost, Innovation in Teaching and Learning.\n\nFind out more about Concordia’s Indigenous Directions.\n \nConcordia welcomes a new senior director of Indigenous Directions and a director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\nIntegrating Indigenous histories, perspectives and knowledge\nTremblay to work closely with members of Concordia’s Indigenous community\nDonna Kahérakwas Goodleaf assumes a new role as director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy\n\n\n\n            Concordia professor uses land-based learning to connect Indigenous youth to cultural teachings\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            3 Concordia researchers collaborate to engage Indigenous knowledges in the study of physics\n        \n\n\n"},
	{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2020/06/29/concordia-welcomes-a-new-indigenous-directions-project-coordinator.html?rootnav=news/stories", "content": "Concordia’s Office of Indigenous Directions has a new project coordinator — alumnus Allan Vicaire (BA 09).\nVicaire reports to Manon Tremblay, senior director of Indigenous Directions. He will support Tremblay, in addition to providing the team with project management expertise and strategic advice on building dialogue and reaching consensus on the execution of their strategic plan. \nIn his new role, Vicaire will also be responsible for coordinating projects that advance the implementation of the Indigenous Directions Action Plan. The plan’s goals are to construct a new, shared future based on responsibility, reciprocity and respect by taking concrete steps toward the decolonization and Indigenization of Concordia.\nAdditionally, Vicaire will be a central figure in maintaining close working relationships with members of the Indigenous Directions Leadership Council, associated working groups and units across the Concordia community. He will also work to establish strong networks with external organizations and stakeholders that include other post-secondary institutions and community organizations.\nVicaire has served as the director of the McGill University First Peoples’ House since 2017, and in the six years previous he was an Indigenous education advisor at McGill’s Social Equity and Diversity Education Office.\nVicaire is currently completing his MA in Education and Society at McGill. He has shared his expertise at a number of local, national and international conferences on topics ranging from raising the profile of Indigenous affairs at a large university to engaging Indigenous youth through culturally rooted science initiatives.\n“Allan brings the Office of Indigenous Directions the very best qualities that we sought in a candidate,” Tremblay says.\n“His track record of accomplishments extends as far and as wide as the positive impact he has had on countless students, faculty, staff and community partners in his previous roles at McGill.”\nShe adds that Vicaire possesses energy, drive and an understanding of the diversity and complexity of Indigenous knowledge systems. “This will enable him to build reciprocal and long-term relationships with Indigenous communities and our many partners in our journey to create a more welcoming and inclusive university for Indigenous students, faculty and staff.”\nCould you tell us a bit about yourself and your work at Concordia?\nAllan Vicaire: I am Mi’kmaw from the Listuguj community and I graduated from Concordia in 2009 with a BA in Political Science.\nI’m proud to be the new project coordinator for the university’s Office of Indigenous Directions. My role is to support senior director Manon Tremblay in her efforts to advance Indigenous affairs on campus.\nMy top priority is working with the community to ensure that we implement the Indigenous Directions Action Plan.\nWhat brought you to stand as such a strong, visible and supportive advocate for change?\nAV: It’s my upbringing. I’m very lucky to come from a supportive community, which remains a constant source of inspiration for me — especially seeing the outstanding work that they do.\nWhat has also inspired me over the last years in higher education are the youth. I’ve witnessed so many students make positive changes on campus through dialogue. I truly admire their tenacity and strength to advocate for change.\nMy community, the people that I’ve met across my life and students have shaped the person that I am today. They have and continue to test me on my beliefs and way of thinking and they push my boundaries. This fuels my desire to be a better person and an agent of change on campus.\nWhat are some of the signs of progress you've witnessed in the evolving relationships between Indigenous students, staff and faculty with universities in Quebec?\nAV: Over the last nine years, I’ve witnessed first-hand the progress of Indigenous affairs on university campuses.\nI’m seeing more and more interest from the university community to engage. I remember when I first started in higher education — it was very challenging to get folks on board in organizing or participating in Indigenous activities. But over time, thanks to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, society has become more aware of who we are, our histories, our resiliency and the success of our communities.\nWhile we still have a long way to go, there have been many successes in Canada. Our voices have been amplified and people began to listen that much more.\nSo, it’s wonderful today to see many institutions taking action to ensure that we educate our youth through meaningful dialogue. I am seeing universities begin to build those relationships with communities. It’s a sign that we are moving in the right direction.\nI also see that universities are beginning to provide the education that our Indigenous students have long asked for. Together, we’re setting up Indigenous studies programs for our students and seeing some institutions allocate additional resources, including scholarships.\nOne of our goals is to widen that path to post-secondary education for Indigenous youth. Whether or not they attend university, we want to ensure that the choice is available to them and that we let them know that we’re here to support them at all levels of the institution.\nWhat do you see as some of the remaining gaps between what Indigenous community members would like to see and what universities offer?\nAV: We definitely require more funding. We still need to build and grow a dedicated space for Indigenous students. We also need to examine where we can build specific supports across the university for Indigenous students. While it is great to have a dedicated space, we can’t be siloed into one space for support. We really need to decolonize all spaces to support our students.\nWe still need to hire more Indigenous faculty and staff across the university. Students want to see themselves reflected in the services they access and the courses they take.\nWe really need to cultivate a space that increases incoming Indigenous scholars. And we need to support these students financially and provide them with the resources to succeed.\nAs former director of the First Peoples' House at McGill, what type of spaces and experiences do you strive to provide for Indigenous students?\nAV: While at McGill, I strove to provide an inclusive, culturally safe space for students — a space where they could find support academically, culturally and a sense of belonging. The First Peoples’ House is a home away from home for students.\nThe most important experience that I wanted to provide students was a sense of community. The First Peoples’ House is very important because many of our students have left their community and moved to a big city like Montreal and can feel a bit lost — especially in the classroom. They do not see themselves reflected in the curriculum nor the student body. It’s very important that we strive to build a community that reflects the cultural values that our students hold in order for them to succeed.\nWhat excites you most when thinking about Concordia's Indigenous Directions?\nAV: What excites me the most is really coming back to Concordia. This is the community where I began to find my voice.\nI was active in the Indigenous student community and, at that time, the Concordia Queer Union. It’s exciting to work and help advance Indigenous affairs on a campus that helped shape me into who I am today.\nI really want to help heighten and advance Indigenous affairs to provide that transformational growth for our upcoming generation.\n\nFind out more about Concordia’s Indigenous Directions Action Plan.\n \nBy James Roach\nConcordia welcomes a new Indigenous Directions project coordinator\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n‘It’s exciting to work and help advance Indigenous affairs on a campus that helped shape me into who I am today’\n\n\n\n            Concordia welcomes a new senior director of Indigenous Directions and a director of decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy\n        \n\n\n"},
